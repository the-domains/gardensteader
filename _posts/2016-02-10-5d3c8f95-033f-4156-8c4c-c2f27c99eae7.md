I created this page to keep track of our backyard gardening progress & to share it with others along our way to living more self sufficiently.

Our 2012 garden was our first "real garden" with more than a few wine barrels with tomato's & peppers. We were bit by gardening bug & I am happy to finally have a hobby that pays me back!

We have since moved to a new home on 1.14 acres & are further exploring micro farming & homesteading techniques in order for our family to live a more sustainable lifestyle.
